# Test Project Outline – Module F — Fun Module

This document outlines the description of Module F. It is circulated to the competitors and experts 3 months prior to
the competition.

This outline only describes the basic information of module F. The actual test project module will be
created by external Test Project Developers using this outline as a guide. The module description will be presented on
C-2 to all experts. The marking scheme will not be presented or supplied to competitors or experts during the
competition.

## Introduction

Module F focuses on having fun with other competitors and being creative.

## Description of project and Tasks

Competitors form groups and create a small web experience.

Competitors are then asked to present their result to the other competitors and the experts. The presentation should
be short, include the explanation of what they created and how they came up with that idea. Also, it should be rounded
off with a demo.

## Assessment

You will be assessed by your presence and participation in the module, that there is a worked out idea, and that the
presentation is done in a professional manner. Attendance is mandatory for all competitors to all presentations.

## Competition time

Competitors will have **2 hours** to complete module F.
