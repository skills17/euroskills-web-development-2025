# Module F – Collaborative Challenge

"What if wind…" powers a game? paints art? solves a social problem? teaches kids? personalises music?

Goal: Create a small web experience that celebrates wind power in Denmark.

You are then asked to present your group's result to the other competitors and the experts.

Your presentation must be divided into three parts:

- A _Hook_ to start the presentation and catch the audience’s attention.
- A _Middle Part_ where you explain your work and might also demonstrate something.
- A _Close_ where you round out the presentation.

The middle part must contain a demo. Additionally, you could include any of these elements or others:

- Ambition: Details of the goal you set yourself.
- Approach: Illustrate how you worked to achieve your goal.
- Impact: What impact would your idea have on the world?
- Journey: Refer to your journey during this module. Show how you worked, what you learned on the way, where you
  succeeded or failed, or what discoveries you made.

## Assessment

You will be assessed by your presence and participation in the module, that there is a worked out idea, and that the
presentation is done in a professional manner. Attendance is mandatory for all competitors to all presentations.
