# Test Project Outline – Module E — Advanced Web Development

This document outlines the description of Module E. It is circulated to the competitors and experts 3 months prior to
the competition.

This outline only describes the basic information of module E. The actual test project module will be
created by external Test Project Developers using this outline as a guide. The module description will be presented on
C-2 to all experts. The marking scheme will not be presented or supplied to competitors or experts during the
competition.

## Introduction

Module E is not focusing on a single topic, but groups several skills that previously were not covered in the test
project. The skills that will be tested in this module are:

1. Writing automated tests
2. OWASP Top 10 Security Vulnerabilities
3. Visual Appearance Preferences

## Description of project and Tasks

__1. Writing automated tests__

The competitor will be given a JavaScript project that has no automated tests. The competitor will have to write
automated unit tests for the project. A complete test set is expected which covers 100% of the provided code. A
provided JavaScript testing framework must be used.

__2. OWASP Top 10 Security Vulnerabilities__

The competitor will be given a JavaScript project that has code security issues. The competitor must find and document
these issues and suggest improvements in an issue tracker.

__3. Visual Appearance Preferences__

The competitors must implement different visual appearances for a website while storing a user's preference.
The implementation must follow industry best practices and may also require the use of various CSS features, such as variables or media queries.

## Assessment

__1. Writing automated tests__

It will be assessed if the created test set is grouped logically and if the tests are written in a way that they are
easy to understand. The test must pass when running against the original code, and not pass any logically mutated
version of that code (Mutation Testing). Each test suite must be submitted in a separate Pull Request with a clear title
and description.

__2. OWASP Top 10 Security Vulnerabilities__

It will be assessed if the issues are documented in a way that they can be understood by a developer with basic
knowledge of security issues. Completeness of the issues will be assessed. False positives will not get points and not
subtracted from the total score.

__3. Visual Appearance Preferences__

It will be assessed if the implemented website and styling follows all listed requirements.
The axe browser extension will be used to assess certain accessibility requirements.

## Competition time

Competitors will have **3 hours** to complete module E.
