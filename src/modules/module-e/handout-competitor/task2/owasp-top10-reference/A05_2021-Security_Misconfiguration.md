# A05:2021 â€“ Security Misconfiguration

## Overview

Moving up from #6 in the previous edition, 90% of applications were
tested for some form of misconfiguration, with an average incidence rate of 4.51%, and over 208k occurrences of a Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) in this risk category. With more shifts into highly configurable software, it's not surprising to see this category move up.
Notable CWEs included are *CWE-16 Configuration* and *CWE-611 Improper
Restriction of XML External Entity Reference*.

## Description

The application might be vulnerable if the application is:

-   Missing appropriate security hardening across any part of the
    application stack or improperly configured permissions on cloud
    services.

-   Unnecessary features are enabled or installed (e.g., unnecessary
    ports, services, pages, accounts, or privileges).

-   Default accounts and their passwords are still enabled and
    unchanged.

-   Error handling reveals stack traces or other overly informative
    error messages to users.

-   For upgraded systems, the latest security features are disabled or
    not configured securely.

-   The security settings in the application servers, application
    frameworks (e.g., Struts, Spring, ASP.NET), libraries, databases,
    etc., are not set to secure values.

-   The server does not send security headers or directives, or they are
    not set to secure values.

-   The software is out of date or vulnerable (see [A06:2021-Vulnerable
    and Outdated Components](A06_2021-Vulnerable_and_Outdated_Components.md)).

Without a concerted, repeatable application security configuration
process, systems are at a higher risk.

## How to Prevent

Secure installation processes should be implemented, including:

-   A repeatable hardening process makes it fast and easy to deploy
    another environment that is appropriately locked down. Development,
    QA, and production environments should all be configured
    identically, with different credentials used in each environment.
    This process should be automated to minimize the effort required to
    set up a new secure environment.

-   A minimal platform without any unnecessary features, components,
    documentation, and samples. Remove or do not install unused features
    and frameworks.

-   A task to review and update the configurations appropriate to all
    security notes, updates, and patches as part of the patch management
    process (see [A06:2021-Vulnerable
    and Outdated Components](A06_2021-Vulnerable_and_Outdated_Components.md)). Review
    cloud storage permissions (e.g., S3 bucket permissions).

-   A segmented application architecture provides effective and secure
    separation between components or tenants, with segmentation,
    containerization, or cloud security groups (ACLs).

-   Sending security directives to clients, e.g., Security Headers.

-   An automated process to verify the effectiveness of the
    configurations and settings in all environments.

## Example Attack Scenarios

**Scenario #1:** The application server comes with sample applications
not removed from the production server. These sample applications have
known security flaws attackers use to compromise the server. Suppose one
of these applications is the admin console, and default accounts weren't
changed. In that case, the attacker logs in with default passwords and
takes over.

**Scenario #2:** Directory listing is not disabled on the server. An
attacker discovers they can simply list directories. The attacker finds
and downloads the compiled Java classes, which they decompile and
reverse engineer to view the code. The attacker then finds a severe
access control flaw in the application.

**Scenario #3:** The application server's configuration allows detailed
error messages, e.g., stack traces, to be returned to users. This
potentially exposes sensitive information or underlying flaws such as
component versions that are known to be vulnerable.

**Scenario #4:** A cloud service provider (CSP) has default sharing
permissions open to the Internet by other CSP users. This allows
sensitive data stored within cloud storage to be accessed.
