# Test Project Outline – Module D — Interactive Frontend using an API

This document outlines the description of Module D. It is circulated to the competitors and experts 3 months prior to
the competition.

This outline only describes the basic information of module D. The actual test project module will be
created by external Test Project Developers using this outline as a guide. The module description will be presented on
C-2 to all experts. The marking scheme will not be presented or supplied to competitors or experts during the
competition.

## Introduction

Module D will focus on the implementation of a frontend for a REST API.

## Description of project and Tasks

The competitors will be asked to create a frontend for a REST API.
Some endpoints of the REST API require authentications and users to log in.

The functionality created by competitors in this module builds on top of the functionality created in module C.
Competitors will be given a working solution of module C at the start of module D, which they must use.
Competitors are not allowed to build on their own module C solution.

The frontend consumes the API, displays pages based on its response, and sends actions triggered by user interactions back to the API.

The frontend additionally features data polling, visualization of data in different ways, and integration of third-party scripts.

Module D can be implemented using a frontend framework and other available libraries.
The application must be a Single Page Application (SPA).
Page reloads must present the same content to the user as previously visible, except unsaved user-driven inputs.
Framework and library availability will be limited and will be decided by all experts using the EuroSkills forums.

## Assessment

Module D will be assessed using the latest stable version of Google Chrome. The assessment will include functional
tests, as well as user experience.

Any modifications in the provided backend of previous modules, including any changes to the database, will not be taken
into account.

## Competition time

Competitors will have **4 hours** to complete module D.
