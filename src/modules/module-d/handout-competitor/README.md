# Handout Module D

## Solution of Module C

The API base URL is:

```
http://[YOUR-SUBDOMAIN]-backend-api.tp.es2025.skill17.com
```

Example:

```
http://asdfg-backend-api.tp.es2025.skill17.com
```

The API spec for the provided solution can be found at: [http://10.17.60.15:8080](http://10.17.60.15:8080)

It uses the same External Turbine API as in Module C.
The control panel is still reachable under the URL:

```
http://[YOUR-SUBDOMAIN]-external-turbine-api.tp.es2025.skill17.com/control
```

Note: There is a **.tp.** in the domain name (which is different from the module URL).

Check that you can reach it by opening it in your browser.

## 3D Turbine Script

The readme containing instructions on how to use the script can be found here:
[https://git.es2025.skill17.com/test-project/3d-turbine](https://git.es2025.skill17.com/test-project/3d-turbine)

It is _not_ required to fork/clone the repository as it does not contain the actual script,
only the readme with instructions.
