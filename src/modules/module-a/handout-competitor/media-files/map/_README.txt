You have been provided a map as an image.
There are different styles to choose from, and all styles show the same area.

Important locations (marking those on the map is up to you according to the requirements of the test project):

Start of the visitor tours: Thyboron (a harbor directly at the coast of Denmark, in the very middle of the image)
Location of the offshore wind farm: 30 km off the West coast (same latitude as Thyboron)
