# Test Project Outline – Module C — REST API

This document outlines the description of Module C. It is circulated to the competitors and experts 3 months prior to
the competition.

This outline only describes the basic information of module C. The actual test project module will be
created by external Test Project Developers using this outline as a guide. The module description will be presented on
C-2 to all experts. The marking scheme will not be presented or supplied to competitors or experts during the
competition.

## Introduction

Module C will focus on the implementation of a REST API.

## Description of project and Tasks

In this module, competitors will develop a secure, database-backed REST API. The backend must fetch and interpret
data from an external API resiliently. The API to implement serves a clean, frontend-ready API.
The API must be secured and support role-based access control.

Public endpoints provide basic data, while protected ones expose control features. A relational database is to be used
for storing data. An OpenAPI specification must be followed, including defined error responses.

## Assessment

Module C will be assessed using tools which directly access the API created by competitors. The API will be tested for
its functionality and its adherence to the specification. The API will also be tested for its security and reliability.

Any modifications in the provided backend of previous modules, including any changes to the database, will not be taken
into account.

## Competition time

Competitors will have **3 hours** to complete module C.

## Mark distribution

The table below outlines how marks are broken down and how they align with the WorldSkills Occupation Standards (WSOS).
